    <h2>
        Who is Jayce?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I was born and raised in Missoula, MT. I went to Big Sky Highschool and
        eventually the University of Montana. I am a sophomore here at U of M, studying
        Computer Science in the Data Science concentration. Outside of school I enjoy swimming
        and exploring the waters of Montana whenever I get the chance. I love to play video
        games and have grown to like meeting people online and getting to chat with a wide range of people
        through virtual means.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Current Aspirations
    </h2>
    <p>
        My current goal for myself professionally is to work in health care data, specifically public health statistics
        or within healthcare databases.
